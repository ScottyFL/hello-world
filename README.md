# hello-world
First Git-hub project :)
Experienced in life for 69 yeaars. Spent 4 years in the Army as a Radar Mechanic. Afterwards got an AS in Digitial Electronics, wored for a couple of years as a tech at TI in Dallas, then got an Industrial Engineering degree in 1978 at Texas A&M.  Worked for 20 years as a Manfacturing Engineer, 5 years of that in Sales. Then spent 17 years in Marine Electronics, doing some programming, circuit board design, monitoring systems design, and AV systems design. Now looking to retire, build an RV from a Transit Van, and do some contract work along the way as I am a die hard practical tech nerd.
